## Google Research

At Google I work on machine learning for science, with a focus on scientific
computing and applications in climate/weather modeling.

I believe that the combination of automatic differentiation software
(e.g., JAX), accelerator hardware (GPU, TPU, etc.) and deep learning are posed
to transform traditional scientific computing, by vastly accelerating and
improving existing numerical methods.

Most of my current work (as of May 2021) focuses on applications involving
simulating Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), and in particular on
[improving simulation methods with machine learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/07/learning-better-simulation-methods-for.html).

Some recent highlights:

- [Machine learning accelerated computational fluid dynamics](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/21/e2101784118) (PNAS 2021)
- [Variational Data Assimilation with a Learned Inverse Observation Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11192) (ICML 2021)

I graduated from the University of Calfornia, Berkeley in 2013 with a Ph.D. in
theoretical physics. My advisor was [Birgitta Whaley](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kbwgrp/).

The topic of dissertaion was [the role of electronic quantum coherence in photosynthetic energy transfer](http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/PBD-quantum-secrets.html).
My main model system was the [Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenna-Matthews-Olson_complex) of green sulfur bacteria (shown above).

## Swarthmore College

At Swarthmore, I majored in [physics](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/physics) and minored in [mathematics](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/math_stat). Here are my final projects for each department:

- Undergraduate thesis: [Quantum random walk search on satisfiability problems](/pubs/thesis.pdf)
- Math senior conference paper: [Classification of completely positive maps](/pubs/math97.pdf)
