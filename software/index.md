I write open source tools for scientific computing in Python.

# pandas

[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a foundational library for data analysis in
Python. I have been a member of the core development team since December 2014.
My main interest with pandas has been extending its capabilities to meet the
needs of physical scientists.

# xray

[xray](http://xray.readthedocs.org) brings the labeled data power of pandas to
the physical sciences, by providing N-dimensional variants of the core pandas
data structures. It was designed to meet the needs of weather and climate data
scientists for working with data in the form of multi-dimensional, labeled
arrays (e.g., as found in netCDF files).

# numbagg

[numbagg](https://github.com/shoyer/numbagg) is an experimental project that
uses numba and NumPy universal functions to write fast N-dimensional array
aggregation functions with very little boilerplate code.

# cyordereddict

[cyordereddict](https://github.com/shoyer/cyordereddict) is a port of the
Python standard library's `OrderedDict` to Cython. It runs 2-6x faster.
