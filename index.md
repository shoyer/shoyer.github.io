# About

I am a physicist, data scientist and software engineer.

Currently, I am a software engineer and researcher at Google on the Accelerated
Sciences team, which leverages Google's unique expertise to solve scientific
research problems. For example, my team has used [deep learning for drug discovery](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/03/large-scale-machine-learning-for-drug.html).

Previously, I was a research scientist at [The Climate
Corporation](http://climate.com), where I worked on models of weather and climate
risk for agriculture. At Climate, I wrote [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray), a
library for labeled arrays in Python.

I am also a [frequent contributor](/software) to the open source scientific Python stack.

I have a [Ph.D in Physics](/physics) from UC Berkeley (2013), and a B.A. in Physics from
Swarthmore College (2008).
