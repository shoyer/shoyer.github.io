# About me

I am a computational scientist and software engineer.

Since 2016, I have been a software engineer and researcher at Google on the
Applied Sciences team. My [current research focus](/science) is on machine
learning for scientific computing. I am also a [frequent contributor](/software)
to open source software for scientific computing in Python.

Previously, I was a data scientist at [The Climate
Corporation](http://climate.com), where I worked on models of weather and climate
risk for agriculture. At Climate, I wrote [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray), a
library for labeled arrays in Python.

Before that, I did a Ph.D in Physics from UC Berkeley (2013), and a B.A. in
Physics from Swarthmore College (2008).
