# About me

I am a versatile physicist, computational scientist and software engineer:

- I am a research lead at Google on the Applied Sciences team, where I focus on
the potential of [deep learning for scientific computing](/science) such as climate &
weather modeling.
- I am also a leader in the [open source software](/software) community for
scientific computing in Python (e.g., Xarray, NumPy and JAX).

I have a Ph.D at UC Berkeley and a B.A. at from Swarthmore College, both in physics.
