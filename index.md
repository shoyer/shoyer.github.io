# About me

I am a research scientist and software engineer with broad expertise in deep learning, physics and scientific computing:

- I am currently a research lead at Google on the Applied Sciences team, where I focus on
[deep learning for scientific computing challenges in the physical sciences](/science), such as climate & weather modeling.
- I am also a leader in the [open source software](/software) community for
scientific computing in Python (e.g., Xarray, NumPy and JAX).

I have a Ph.D from UC Berkeley and a B.A. from Swarthmore College, both in physics.
