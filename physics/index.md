# Ph.D.

I graduated from the University of Calfornia, Berkeley in 2013 with a Ph.D. in
theoretical physics. My advisor was [Birgitta Whaley](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kbwgrp/).

# Research

My dissertation research was on [the role of electronic quantum coherence in photosynthetic energy transfer](http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/PBD-quantum-secrets.html):

- Does quantum coherence contribute to biological function in photosynthesis?
- How can we use statistics, optimization and quantum information theory to design ultrafast  spectroscopy experiments on photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes?

My main model system was the [Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenna-Matthews-Olson_complex) of green sulfur bacteria (shown right).

My work involved developing new mathematical techniques, more efficient computational methods and research software (in Python) that I am still preparing to open source. I took part in collaborations across 3 continents, wrote 6 papers (2 more in progress) and presented at 12 international conferences. I was supported by a [fellowship](http://science.energy.gov/wdts/scgf/) from the Department of Energy Office of Science.

## Writing from Swarthmore

At Swarthmore College, I majored in [physics](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/physics) and minored in [mathematics](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/math_stat). Here are my final projects for each department:

- Undergraduate thesis: [Quantum random walk search on satisfiability problems](/pubs/thesis.pdf)
- Math senior conference paper: [Classification of completely positive maps](/pubs/math97.pdf)
